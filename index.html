                    August 2022 - Oktober 2023<br>
                    Worked as a salesman for Intersport, where I sold different retail products. From this job I got
                    experience with customer service and how to work with other co-workers in the best manner. It
                    also made me better at being independent in my workday, as I often had to find more work to do
                    on my own.<br><br>

                    August 2023 - Current date<br>
                    Working as a student assistant, I help other students with their course. I help them finish
                    their assignments, and I also grade their assignments. In addition to this I am sort of a middle
                    man between the students and the lecturer. I also help them with the course in general, and help
                    students understand everything within the course, if they have any questions regarding tasks,
                    the lecture etc.

                    <strong>Hobbies</strong><br>
                    In my sparetime I like to workout, in addition to just relax with friends and enjoy my time. I
                    like
                    to go for hikes when the weather is nice, or just go for a run for exercise. Staying healthy is
                    important for me, so my spare time often go to some kind of exercise.
                    In addition to this I also like to play video games, board games or any other kind of games.
                    Games
                    have always been part of my life, since I was little. So it always brings me joy when I get to
                    play
                    with my friends. It is also a nice way to get a break from the real world, and just enjoy some
                    made
                    up world on a screen or on a board.<br><br>
