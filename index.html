                    August 2022 - Oktober 2023<br>
                    Worked as a salesman for Intersport, where I sold different retail products. From this job I got
                    experience with customer service and how to work with other co-workers in the best manner. It
                    also made me better at being independent in my workday, as I often had to find more work to do
                    on my own.<br><br>

                    <strong> Student Assistant</strong>

                    University of Bergen<br>
                    August 2023 - Current date<br>
                    Working as a student assistant, I help other students with their course. I help them finish
                    their assignments, and I also grade their assignments. In addition to this I am sort of a middle
                    man between the students and the lecturer. I also help them with the course in general, and help
                    students understand everything within the course, if they have any questions regarding tasks,
                    the lecture etc.
